What is something you learned by reviewing your peerâ€™s project?
Something I learned was that you could get your colors to switch from being green to red if they are/aren't in the right position.
What is something you saw in your peerâ€™s project that you would like to apply to your own programming projects?
That switching colors thing is exactly what I would like to add to mine.
What suggestions would you have for your peer to improve his/her code?
N/A
What could have been clearer or better commented?
I at first thought it would be better to have instructions but those are in the readme so all if fair.
Was there anything in the code that was confusing to you? If so, what?

What is something he/she could add to the README.md to make it more descriptive?
It's pretty descriptive and sincere.
Pay a compliment to your peer based on the quality of his/her code.
